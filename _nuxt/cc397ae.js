This platform comes with one web-based application that can manage accounting, reservation, customers, multi-branches, and more. It is currently being used by 10 cafes in Tehran, Iran.</p></div><div data-v-266a827c><h6 data-v-266a827c>My Role</h6><p data-v-266a827c>I was a UI design intern, working with a senior designer, primarily responsible for developing sketches, wireframes, UI design, and prototype. I also helped with user research (competitive audits, interviews and digital survey) and graphic designs.</p></div></div></div><div class="processWrapper" data-v-266a827c><div data-v-266a827c><h6 data-v-266a827c>The Process</h6><div class="processBox" data-v-266a827c><p data-v-266a827c>This project was structured into roughly 3 stages: research, design, and evaluation. My responsibilities in the project was mainly to design based on the research findings or irritate based on evaluation feedbacks.</p><img class="responsiveImage" src="/namak_process.png" alt="Namak Process" data-v-266a827c></div></div></div><div class="descriptionWrapper" data-v-266a827c><div data-v-266a827c><div class="shieldFirst" data-v-266a827c><img src="/price.png" alt="" data-v-266a827c></div><div class="shieldSecond" data-v-266a827c><img src="/branch.png" alt="" data-v-266a827c></div><h6 data-v-266a827c>Research</h6><div data-v-266a827c><h6 data-v-266a827c>The Problem</h6><p data-v-266a827c>The lack of adequately integrated management software for cafes and restaurants forced many cafe managers to use multiple software or do things like reservations by hand. The software for cafes currently used in Iran is complicated and requires learning to achieve simple tasks. The software has remained the same with no updates for pain points by not having any good competition. There is a serious need for a better alternative that can manage accounting and reservation across different branches. The website is developed primarily for cafes but can be used by restaurants, bars, and shops. </p></div><div data-v-266a827c><h6 data-v-266a827c>The Challenges</h6><p data-v-266a827c>I joined the team mid-phase. In addition to new features, some iterations for the current designs were necessary; however, since some were already implemented, there was a limitation in resources and freedom in iteration. Other challenges included achieving a decent understanding of current accounting and management software and how cafe management works in the real world. Introducing a new way for management to the market was also a challenge that should have been considered from the start. </p></div><div data-v-266a827c><h6 data-v-266a827c>User Research</h6><p data-v-266a827c>During my internship, I helped the team senior designer conduct interviews with 5 cafe owners and 10 workers. I was in charge of documenting some of the results and completing the competitive studies. As I joined the team a couple of months after the start, much of the user research was already done, and the results were shared with me. However, later, separate digital surveys and usability studies were conducted to evaluate the design before production. </p><p data-v-266a827c>The documentation for this product that is aimed at the Iranian market was done in Persian to be easily understandable for everyone on the team.</p></div></div></div><div class="designWrapper descriptionWrapper" data-v-266a827c><div data-v-266a827c><h6 data-v-266a827c>Design</h6><p data-v-266a827c>At the time, product owner was in a rush to move quickly through the design process for obvious reasons. However, for each given task, I did a couple of hand sketches and paper wireframes to get as much idea out as possible with low commitment and in a short time. Checking with the senior designer, I refined the sketches before moving to the high-fidelity design. I moved on to producing visual designs. During this phase, one goal was to create an approachable, friendly, and seamless experience in a somewhat complex context.</p><div data-v-266a827c><img class="responsiveImage centeredImage mt-3" src="/namak_design.png" alt="Design" data-v-266a827c></div></div></div><div class="descriptionWrapper" data-v-266a827c><div data-v-266a827c><div class="shieldThird" data-v-266a827c><img src="/support.png" alt="" data-v-266a827c></div><h6 data-v-266a827c>Evaluation</h6><p data-v-266a827c>The final version of the prototype was put to test. 15 volunteers with background in cafe management were asked to use the design to complete pre-assigned task while thinking aloud and proceed to answer a couple of questions afterwards as an interview to help us better understand possible broken interactions or pain points. After this step was completed, necessary iterations were made in the design and it was hand-offed to the development team.</p></div></div></section>',1);function o(t,f,w,b,y,k){const p=i.Z,l=n.Z;return(0,e.wg)(),(0,e.iD)("div",d,[(0,e.Wm)(p),r,(0,e.Wm)(l)])}const c={};var h=a(6058);const v=(0,h.Z)(c,[["render",o],["__scopeId","data-v-266a827c"]])}}]);
