It is designed with the need of the seniors in mind and offers a simple anxiety-free experience for the user to connect to their family and friends. The app can be personalized through the family members&#39; platform to fit each user&#39;s needs perfectly. It comes with a guide for turning any tablet into a video calling device and also functions as a pill reminder, digital frame, and remote monitoring and notification for emergencies.</p></div><div data-v-23ab72d4><h6 data-v-23ab72d4>My Role</h6><p data-v-23ab72d4>I&#39;m the sole designer in this project, and it is for my master&#39;s thesis.

Being a tech-enthusiast concerned with equality - better to say equity - I paid more attention to how underrepresented groups interact with smart devices. Through family and friends, I observed how seniors avoid using the internet or have trouble keeping up and always need assistance to do most things. I realized just how much some struggle to do their jobs (that have become remote due to quarantine) and how some still take hours of their day to do some tasks that can be done under 5 minutes with the internet.</p><p data-v-23ab72d4>In particular, I focused on how my elderly grandparents wait around for someone to visit to ask them to call their sons, daughters, and grandchildren who live abroad. Even though they own smart devices, they never use them because, and I quote, “they’re too complicated.” And that bothers me. We’re at a time that can have access to almost anything instantly, and it’s undeniable how the internet and smart devices have become an inseparable part of our daily lives. However, a group of people has been deprived of their benefits because they have been ignored in the market for years, mainly because they need specially designed apps which almost all companies aren’t interested in invest in since there’s a smaller potential market and subsequently less profit in it.</p></div></div></div><div class="quotaWrapper mt-3 mb-3" data-v-23ab72d4><div data-v-23ab72d4><div class="quotaIcon" data-v-23ab72d4><span data-v-23ab72d4>“</span></div><div class="textWrapper" data-v-23ab72d4><strong data-v-23ab72d4>These [smart devices] are for young people, not us.

The idea for this project started with exploring a common problem, the difficulties of technologies for the elderly, and emerged to an application for solving a daily struggle for most seniors and elderly whose families live in different cities/countries or can&#39;t visit due to temporary situational problems (ex. the covid pandemic). A primary discovery phase was necessary to figure out the issues in users&#39; life. After the primary problem was defined, it was time to specify the problem I desired to solve in this project. Each phase was repeated as many times as needed, and this wasn&#39;t a linear process, as expected from the double diamond method.</p></div><div class="targetWrapper" data-v-23ab72d4><div data-v-23ab72d4><img class="responsiveImage" src="'+v+'" alt="Discover" data-v-23ab72d4><span data-v-23ab72d4>Discover</span></div><div data-v-23ab72d4><img class="responsiveImage" src="'+c+'" alt="Define" data-v-23ab72d4><span data-v-23ab72d4>Define</span></div><div data-v-23ab72d4><img class="responsiveImage" src="'+h+'" alt="Develop" data-v-23ab72d4><span data-v-23ab72d4>Develop</span></div><div data-v-23ab72d4><img class="responsiveImage" src="'+p+'" alt="Deliver" data-v-23ab72d4><span data-v-23ab72d4>Deliver</span></div></div></div></div><div class="descriptionWrapper" data-v-23ab72d4><div class="pl-3 pr-3" data-v-23ab72d4><h6 data-v-23ab72d4>Discover</h6><div data-v-23ab72d4><h6 data-v-23ab72d4>The Problem</h6><p data-v-23ab72d4>The quick advancement of the technologies has led to a usage gap between those who have grown with it and those who have never really used it. Some older people tend to avoid using technologies altogether because of underlying causes, previous bad experiences, or not seeing how it can benefit them, especially if they&#39;ve never used the internet or a smartphone before. Subsequently, they are missing out on these opportunities for communication which can leave seniors feeling disconnected and lonely. Having regular contact with a close circle of friends or family can alleviate the feeling of loneliness, something which is not always possible, whether it&#39;s because of the cost of meeting up, long-distance or situational problems like the covid pandemic.</p><p data-v-23ab72d4>Not many digital products have been made for the needs of this group of users, and most of them are expensive to buy or subscribe which can be a hardship since many seniors have a lower income. Other similar products have a frustrating learning curve for seniors or cannot be used without assistance. </p><p data-v-23ab72d4>The problem I wanted to address is the need for &quot;an accessible application for making and answering video calls that are suitable for physical and mental needs of the senior and elderly users that have little to no previous experience with technologies and can be used without further assistance.&quot; to try to lessen the impact of the technological gap that has prevented the seniors from utilizing the available technologies for the endless possibilities of a better and easier life.</p></div></div></div><div class="quotaWrapper customSecondQuota" data-v-23ab72d4><div data-v-23ab72d4><div class="textWrapper" data-v-23ab72d4><strong data-v-23ab72d4>As many as 77 percent of seniors report that they would require assistance were they to try and learn how to use a smartphone or tablet.</strong><p data-v-23ab72d4>Pew Research Centre, 2014</p></div></div></div><div class="descriptionWrapper" data-v-23ab72d4><div data-v-23ab72d4><div data-v-23ab72d4><h6 data-v-23ab72d4>Underlying Causes</h6><p data-v-23ab72d4>There are many reasons, some might still be unknown, why seniors refuse to use technologies.

I conducted the test with five people that were more familiar with the design and development of software but didn’t meet the age criteria.
